# LAMP - Language Assistant: Modular Phrases

## Overview
LAMP is a personal language learning assistant that automates the process of capturing, organizing, and practicing English phrases. It extracts phrases from screenshots—such as those taken from YouTube videos or eBooks—and transforms them into usable learning materials.


## Background
While scrolling through YouTube Shorts or reading English novels, I often come across phrases that feel useful or worth remembering. I usually take a screenshot to save them, but over time, my photo gallery becomes cluttered with random images. The problem is—I rarely go back to review those screenshots. They just sit there and pile up, becoming digital clutter instead of a learning resource. LAMP was created to solve that: to turn those spontaneous captures into an automated, structured, and interactive learning tool.


## Key Features
	•	OCR Integration: Automatically detects and extracts English phrases from image-based screenshots.
	•	Phrase Organization: Stores and categorizes phrases in a searchable, structured format.
	•	Contextual Example Generation: Uses Mistral LLM to generate realistic usage examples for each phrase.
	•	Spaced Repetition & Review: Enables consistent practice and retention over time.


## Goal
To automate the learning process by turning phrase screenshots into actionable practice content—so your photo gallery becomes a dynamic language resource, not just a cluttered archive.
